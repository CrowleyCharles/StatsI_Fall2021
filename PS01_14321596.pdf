	\section*{Question 1 (50 points): Education}

A school counselor was curious about the average of IQ of the students in her school and took a random sample of 25 students' IQ scores. The following is the data set:\\
\vspace{.5cm}

\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=40, lastline=40]{PS01.R}  

\vspace{1cm}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find a 90\% confidence interval for the average student IQ in the school.\\	
	The confidence internvals for the average student is calculated as follows:
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=54, lastline=59]{PS01.R} 
m <- mean(y)
s <- sd(y)
n <- length(y)
error <- qt(0.95, df = n-1) * s/sqrt(n)
m + error
m - error
	
	The confidence intervals are 102.9201, 93.95993

	
	\item Next, the school counselor was curious  whether  the average student IQ in her school is higher than the average IQ score (100) among all the schools in the country.\\ 
	
	\noindent Using the same sample, conduct the appropriate hypothesis test with $\alpha=0.05$.
	
	Firstly we set out our hypothesis that H0:>100. We do not set a second hypothesis as we are only looking to see if our value exceeds the national average of 100 for an IQ score.
	 
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=69, lastline=69]{PS01.R} 
t.test(y, mu=100, alternative="greater", conf.level= 0.95) #one sided, this is the one we use
We recieve a output of the following:

One Sample t-test

data:  y
t = -0.59574, df = 24, p-value = 0.7215
alternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 100
95 percent confidence interval:
93.95993      Inf
sample estimates:
mean of x 
98.44  
	
    if p-value ≤α reject H0
	if p-value >α fail to reject H0
	p-value = 0.7215, and our α is 0.05, this therefore means we are unable to reject the null hypothesis as p value > α. 
	
\end{enumerate}

	\section*{Question 2 (50 points): Political Economy}

\noindent Researchers are curious about what affects the amount of money communities spend on addressing homelessness. The following variables constitute our data set about social welfare expenditures in the USA. \\
\vspace{.5cm}


\begin{tabular}{r|l}
	\texttt{State} &\emph{50 states in US} \\
	\texttt{Y} & \emph{per capita expenditure on shelters/housing assistance in state}\\
	\texttt{X1} &\emph{per capita personal income in state} \\
	\texttt{X2} &  \emph{Number of residents per 100,000 that are "financially insecure" in state}\\
	\texttt{X3} &  \emph{Number of people per thousand residing in urban areas in state} \\
	\texttt{Region} &  \emph{1=Northeast, 2= North Central, 3= South, 4=West} \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{.5cm}
\noindent Explore the \texttt{expenditure} data set and import data into \texttt{R}.
\vspace{.5cm}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=54, lastline=54]{PS01.R}  
\vspace{.5cm}
\begin{itemize}

\item
Please plot the relationships among \emph{Y}, \emph{X1}, \emph{X2}, and \emph{X3}? What are the correlations among them (you just need to describe the graph and the relationships among them)?

This code gives us the matrixs for the variables we are plotting.

As we can see from our scatter matrix plot there is weak to little correlation between any of the variables, this would suggest they are bivariate data sets. This shows no relationship as the scatterplot appears to be random, with no tilt.

\item
Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{Region}? On average, which region has the highest per capita expenditure on housing assistance?

plot(expenditure$Y,expenditure$Region,xlab="Spending Per Capita on shelter",ylab="Region",pch=21)
title("SP of Regions Spending on Shelter")
As we can see from the code below I have been able to obtain the mean values for each of the 4 groups. This shows that the West spends on average USD 88.30 per capita on housing and shelter.   
\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=116, lastline=116]{PS01.R}
    aggregate(expenditure$Y, by = list(expenditure$Region), FUN = mean
    
North East - 79.44444
North West - 83.91667
South      - 69.18750
West       - 88.30769  
\vspace{.5cm}
\item
Please plot the relationship between \emph{Y} and \emph{X1}? Describe this graph and the relationship. Reproduce the above graph including one more variable \emph{Region} and display different regions with different types of symbols and colors.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{}
	}
We can see that there is a positive correlation with Y and X1, as when a state's income per capita increase it correlates with an increase with a state's spending on housing. This can be seen with the "red line" in our graph whcih skews right and upward.
 \lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=119, lastline=121]{PS01.R}
 lines(expenditure$Y, fitted(expenditure), col="red")
 abline(lm(expenditure$Y ~ expenditure$X1), col = "red")
 abline(lm(expenditure$X1  ~ expenditure$Y), col = "red")

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Rplot part3}
	\caption{xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}
	The code below has added a new variable and had added new clours 
	plot(expenditure$X1, expenditure$Y | expenditure$Region, 
	xlab="spending per capita on shelter", ylab= "per capita income", main="SP of State Income/Spending on Shelter/region"
	,col=c("red", "yellow", "pink", "orange", "green"), pch=19)
